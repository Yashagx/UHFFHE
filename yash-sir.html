<div class="text">
  
  <p>
    As a student of <span class="font-semibold">SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur</span>, under the 
    <span class="font-semibold">College of Engineering and Technology</span>, <span class="font-semibold">School of Computing</span>, 
    <span class="font-semibold">Department of Computational Intelligence</span>, I embarked on a truly special journey as part of the 
    <span class="font-semibold">21GNP301L - Community Connect</span> course. When given the chance to contribute to society, I chose to associate myself with the inspiring NGO, 
    <span class="font-semibold">United Health Forum for Health and Environment</span>‚Äîan organization dedicated to nurturing young minds and giving them the opportunities they deserve.
  </p>

  <p>
    The students I worked with ranged from <span class="font-semibold">Class 1 to Class 8</span>, each carrying eyes full of dreams and an unspoken hunger to learn.
    For the <span class="font-semibold">younger children</span>, I created a fun and interactive learning environment. We played 
    <span class="font-semibold">educational games</span>, conducted <span class="font-semibold">quizzes</span>, and explored 
    <span class="font-semibold">basic computer skills</span> together. Watching their eyes light up when they learned something new was magical. Their innocence, energy, and unfiltered happiness made every single moment unforgettable.
    With the <span class="font-semibold">older children</span>, I stepped into the role of a mentor and friend. I had the joy of introducing them to the world of 
    <span class="font-semibold">programming through Python</span> and giving them a glimpse into <span class="font-semibold">web development</span>. Over a span of just 
    <span class="font-semibold">two months</span>, these bright young minds not only learned to code but went on to 
    <span class="font-semibold">design, build, and proudly host their very first website</span>. Witnessing that transformation‚Äîfrom hesitant first steps to the pride of seeing their work live on the internet‚Äîwas incredibly emotional and fulfilling.
  </p>

  <p>
    What touched me the most was their <span class="font-semibold">enthusiasm and eagerness to learn</span>, despite the challenges they face. The 
    <span class="font-semibold">love and warmth</span> with which they welcomed me every day, their smiles, their cheerful greetings, and their innocent questions became the highlight of my day. I often found myself counting down the hours until evening, eagerly waiting to be with them again.
    <span class="italic">Time flew whenever I was with them. I never once checked the clock.</span>
    This journey was not just about teaching them; it was equally about <span class="font-semibold">learning from them</span>. I learned about 
    <span class="font-semibold">resilience</span>, <span class="font-semibold">curiosity</span>, and the power of 
    <span class="font-semibold">pure human connection</span>. It reinforced in me a belief that 
    <span class="font-semibold">education should never be a privilege reserved for a few‚Äîit should be a right for all</span>.
    The experience left me with a <span class="font-semibold">profound sense of gratitude and purpose</span>‚Äîto use the opportunities and knowledge I‚Äôve been blessed with to uplift others, to bridge gaps, and to continue lighting small sparks of curiosity wherever I go.
  </p>

  <p class="text-blue-700 font-semibold">
    To all the children I taught: <br>
    You are incredible. Keep dreaming, keep learning, and never stop believing in the magic you hold within. The world needs your light.
